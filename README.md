# Hi, I'm Faraz.

### AI Engineer & Educator

I break down complex AI concepts into open-source tutorials.  
My goal is to make concepts in the AI/gen-AI field accessible—whether you are building a local LLM pipeline or understanding the math behind attention mechanisms.

## 📚 Teaching & Tutorials

I spend a lot of time deconstructing how AI actually works. These repositories are designed as step-by-step guides for developers who want to learn by doing.

### 🧠 Advanced AI & LLM Architecture

**[Transformers Deep Dive](https://github.com/FarazFazelifar/Transformers-Deep-Dive)** *Understanding the engine behind the hype.* Using LLMs is easy; understanding them is not. I created this repo to break down the Transformer architecture, the Attention mechanism, and the math that powers modern AI.
* **Focus:** Deep Learning, Transformer Architecture, Attention Mechanisms.

**[Introduction to RAG](https://github.com/FarazFazelifar/Introduction-to-RAG)** *Retrieval-Augmented Generation, demystified.* RAG is the industry standard for custom AI context. This repo strips away the complexity and shows you how to build a generic RAG system from scratch without relying on black-box tools.
* **Focus:** Vector DBs, Embeddings, Context Retrieval.

**[Local AutoGen Agents](https://github.com/FarazFazelifar/Local-AutoGen-Agents-Tutorial)** *Autonomous Agents without the OpenAI bill.* Most Agent tutorials require paid API keys. I wrote this guide to show how you can run Microsoft's AutoGen completely locally using Ollama.
* **Focus:** AutoGen, Ollama, Local Model Orchestration.

** **[LlamaIndex Retrievers](https://github.com/FarazFazelifar/llamaindex-retrievers)** A technical comparison of different retrieval strategies to see how they impact answer quality.
* **Focus:** LlamaIndex, RAG and retrieval methods

### 📉 Foundations & Data Science

**[Introduction to Python for Data Science](https://github.com/FarazFazelifar/Introduction-to-Python-for-Data-Science)** *The building blocks.* Before you can build AI, you need to master the data. This is my collection of notebooks covering the essentials of Python, NumPy, and Pandas for aspiring data scientists.

## 🚀 Applied Projects

When I'm not writing tutorials, I build tools to put these concepts into practice.

* **[StudyBuddyAI](https://github.com/FarazFazelifar/StudyBuddyAI):** A RAG-based study companion that reads textbooks and quizzes students. Built to test how LLMs handle large educational PDFs.
* **[AI Resume Assistant](https://github.com/FarazFazelifar/AI-resume-assistant):** A Streamlit app using Llama 3.2 to rewrite resumes and generate professional PDFs.
* **[AI Idea Factory](https://github.com/FarazFazelifar/AI-Idea-Factory):** An experiment in multi-agent collaboration where AI "employees" brainstorm project ideas.
